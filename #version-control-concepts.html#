            <p> News flash - You have all been
              implementing some form of hacked-together ad
              hoc version control for years. Version control
              is a strcture and process for something that
              people started doing ever since they needed
              more than one copy or version of the same
              file.</p>
            <p>So, congrats. You are already experts.</p>

              up together.</p>
            
			<ul>
              <li>Repository: A container or warehouse
                for a single project or codebase. A
                repository contains the code AND the
                metadata such as history, tags, branches,
                etc. There is usually a master respository
                somewhere. It is usually referred to as
                origin. Git tracks changes between a local
                clone and origin.</li>
              <li>Cloning: A fancy word for copying a
                repository. </li>
	          <li>Branch: A single repository can have
	            multiple copies of the same code-base, all
	            in different states. Remember the ad hoc
	            version control example from a couple of
	            slides back? Any time you have two or more
	            files, with slightly different names, each
	            with a specific semantic meaning, you have
	            implemented an ad hoc branching
	            system. Git isn't doing anything new. It
	            is giving you a structure and a set of
	            tools. Branches are integral to using Git
	            successfully. A single project can have
	            many branches. Each branch has a different
	            purpose. Most projects will have a primary
	            branch called master or trunk. This branch
	            is the primary branch. Typically, only a
	            few people can edit the master branch
	            directly. But, each user can clone the
	            project and can create their own branches,
	            which they can save changes to.</li>
			  <li>Commit: This is like saving a file, on
				steroids. You still have to save the
				file(s). A commit is a collection of
				changes, sometimes spanning multiple files
				that are all related in some way. For
				example, they may introduce a new feature
				or fix a bug. Whatever. The changes are
				all connected to one another. When you
				make a commit, you get to briefly explain
				what the change(s) you are committing do,
				why, etc. If you have ever come across a
				ad hoc version controlled file and not
				understood why a certain change was made,
				this is your solution. This (should) tell
				you the who, where, when, what, how and
				why of EVERY SINGLE CHANGE made to the
				codebase. Full accountability. Full
				history.</li>
			  <li>Pull / Push: Pulling and pushing are
				the first way how Git enable
				collaboration. Somewhere, there is a
				central or master repository. It is the
				official, canonical code base for the
				application. Users can push and pull to /
				from this master repository. Often a
				specific branch or branches are locked,
				and can only be altered by specific
				people. But all developers can create and
				push to their own branches. </li>
              <li>Pull Request: A pull request is a
                public statement that you think your code
                is ready for peer review and / or
                acceptance into the master branch.</li>

          <h1>Centralized Workflow</h1>
          <img src="svg/centralized_01.svg">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p> Feature Branch Workflow is one commonly
              used Git workflow for small to medium-sized
              projects, which makes ideal for the complexity
              level found in most research related code
              bases. These code bases tend to be small, and
              this workflow strikes a good balance between
              complexity and integrity. </p>
            <p>This is largely the model we have been
              using for the Quarterly QA reports. With the
              QA reports, I am doing more complex branching,
              but I'm largely hiding it from everyone.</p>

        <section>
          <p> In a Centralized Workflow, there is a master
            repository, which everyone clones to his or her
            local system.</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>This is the most commonly used work flow
              for one-person projects or where one person is
              driving the development and other programmers
              are primarily users of the code.</p>
            <p>Each cloned repository is full copy of the
              project. Local users can create and destroy
              local branches.</p>

        <section>
          <img src="svg/centralized_02.svg" height="512">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>In a one-person project, development often
              happens directly on the master branch. As
              commits are made, they are pushed to the
              central repository which stores a linear
              history of development.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <img src="svg/centralized_03.svg">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>If there are two or more developers, it is
              almost inevitable that they will get out of
              sync with one another. In this case, developer
              B (light blue) is working on something and the
              primary developer has pushed a change, to the
              primary master branch AFTER the developer in
              light blue clones the repository.</p>
            <p>This is not a problem, because Git will
              help the developer identify and merge these
              changes, from the master repository into the
              local copy.</p>
